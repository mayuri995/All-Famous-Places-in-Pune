So, if you get exhausted while experiencing the city life or knowing the oldest caves and fortresses, the gardens in Pune are a perfect escape to refresh your soul.</p>

And if you are visiting Pune, the Okayama Friendship garden deserves to be on your list of places to see for its eye-catching beauty.</p>
           <p>Located on the Sinhagad Road in Dattawadi, Okayama Garden represents the friendship between Japan and Pune. The captivating landscape and the cultural significance have made the park one of the best sightseeing places in Pune.</p>
           <h3>History of Okayama Friendship Garden</h3>
<p>In 1998, when Pune’s Mayor Dattatreya Gaikwad formed a “sister city” bond with Berman, eight other cities all over the globe came across to tie a knot with Pune. Among those eight cities, one of the most valuable “sister cities” of Pune was Okayama in Japan.</p>

<p>If you have never heard of the concept of sister cities, consider this as a legal or social agreement between two different (politically & geographically) cities for forming commercial and cultural ties. The concept of sister cities or international links between two cities began after the second world war. The idea behind developing such relations was to promote solidarity between the cities in allied countries that faced the devastating events of the war</p>
      <p>To mark the Indo-Japanese friendship between Okayama and Pune, Okayama Friendship Garden was created under the sister city initiatives. The design of the friendship garden was inspired by Okayama’s 300-year-old famous Korakuen Garden. The park was built in 1700, across 12 hectares, by the Ikeda royal family.
</p> 
     <p>The Okayama Friendship Garden is also known as the Pu. La. Deshpande Udayan. It was named after well known Marathi writer and humorist Purushottam Laxman Deshpande. He won the Padma Bhushan in 1990. After his death, the Pune Municipal Corporation named the garden after him.
</p>
      <p>Many rulers in India build gardens for either relaxation or for aesthetic pleasure. But for traditional Japanese culture, gardens were built to symbolise peace. They are inspired by Buddhist, Taoist, and Shinto philosophies that consider gardens as a place for meditation and spiritual practices.
</p>
    <p>The Okayama Friendship Garden in Pune strives to establish the Japanese tradition in India to build a peaceful and cultural relationship between the two countries.

</p>
<h4>History of Jejuri</h4>
<p>The Khandoba Temple in Jejuri dates back to the 12th and 13th centuries, with its initial construction taking place in 1608 AD. The Maratha chief Ragho Mambaji completed the hall and other structures by 1637 AD, while subsequent enhancements were made by the Holker rulers. Between 1737 and 1739, Chimaji Appa, the sibling of Peshwa Baji Rao I, donated church bells from Portuguese churches in Vasai to the temple. These bells were taken as trophies following Chimaji Appa's victory over the Portuguese in the Battle of Vasai in 1737. In 1742 AD, Tukoji Holkar contributed by adding pillars, and he finalized the battlefields and tank by 1770 AD. Additionally, shepherds who revered Khandoba as their family deity constructed staircases, lamps, cloisters, canopies, and gateways.</p>
<h4>Mythology of Jejuri</h4>
<p>The temple at Jejuri is considered one of the foremost centers of worship for Lord Khandoba, whose origins are intertwined with mythological narratives about Lord Shiva's incarnation to kill demons. Lord Khandoba, also referred to as Khanderaya, is revered as the Kuladevata by numerous farming families, Brahmins, and the nomadic Dhangar tribe in the Maharashtra and Deccan regions.</p>
<p>As per the legend, Khandoba is revered as a warrior deity who battled the demons Mani and Malla. He was supported by his two wives, Mhalsa and Banai, who are also honored alongside him in the temple. Mhalsa, the daughter of a merchant, is considered an incarnation of Goddess Parvati, while Banai, a shepherdess, is viewed as an incarnation of Goddess Ganga. Khandoba wed both women on the same day and at the same location, which is now the site of the temple.
</p>
<h4>Things to do in Jejuri</h4>

<p>Elevated at 2,356 feet, the Gad Kot temple, also referred to as Jejuri gad, can be accessed via three sets of steps from the east, west, and north. The northern staircase leads directly to the temple's main entrance. This temple features around 450 steps, 18 arches, and approximately 350 Deepmalas. Enclosing the main temple is an eight-sided fort boundary that stretches 350 yards (320 meters) in length. The entrance is embellished with a large statue of Nandi.
</p>
<p>Constructed in the Hemadpanthi architectural style, the temple comprises an outer square hall and an inner sanctum. Within the sanctum lies a linga, symbolizing Shiva, along with three pairs of images depicting Khandoba and his first wife, Mhalsa. Additionally, there is a murti of Khandoba depicted as a warrior on horseback. Worship practices for Khandoba include offerings of turmeric, belfruit leaves, and naivedhya made from onions and various vegetables. Devotees also present flowers and turmeric to the deity, often tossing turmeric into the air as a form of offering, resulting in the steps and surroundings of the hill temple being tinged with a yellow hue.

             <h3>  The entry fee for the National War Museum in Pune is ₹20 per adult, according to Tripadvisor.</h3> <p>It is a popular tourist attraction in Pune, commemorating Indian soldiers who died in the line of duty. <h3>The museum is open from 9 AM to 5 PM, but is closed on Wednesdays, </h3>according to Tripadvisor. </p>
           <p>Pune, a city that resounds with vibrancy and energy, is one of the top tourist attractions of Maharashtra. Besides being bestowed with the title ‘Oxford of the East,’ it is also a major Army base with rich history and war scars that remain a close part of the city. Southern Command is headquartered in Pune and has a few tourist spots that will bring you closer to the city’s history.

One such astounding gateway for people interested in the history of Indian defence is the National War Memorial Southern Command in Pune. It commemorates the stories and sacrifices of the Indian soldiers right here. This quaint little place resonates with the bravery of post-independence Indian soldiers coupled with a beautiful garden around it.</p>
             <img src="national3.jpg" alt="Nationalwar">
           <p>The Memorial strengthens the sense of belonging, high moral values, sacrifice and national pride in our citizens. It stands testimony to the sacrifices made by our soldiers during various conflicts, United Nations Operations, Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Response Operations since Independence.</p>
<img src="national2.jpg" alt="Nationalwar">
     <h3> Why is the war memorial famous?</h3>
<p>These memorials are important because they act as historical touchstones. They link the past to the present and enable people to remember and respect the sacrifice of those who died, fought, participated or were affected by conflict(s).</p>
  <h3>History of National War Memorial Southern Command</h3>
  <p>The silver jubilee celebration of the victory of India over Pakistan in 1971 initiated the idea to set up a memorial for the post-independence martyrs. To mark the gratitude of our frontline warriors, Pune citizens formed a committee under the Indian Express where they came forward to erect the memorial without government aid or initiative.</p>
  <p>Brig N.M. Grat was the then chairman of the committee and approached the Southern Command wing to ask for a suitable piece of land. The board promptly acted upon the idea, and the place inaugurated the ever beautiful memorial on 15th August 1998.</p>

        <h1>Pashanlake</h1></div>
         <img src="pashanlake.jpg" alt="pashanlake">
         <p>This 100-year-old lake was home to numerous birds in the ’70s and ’80s. Today the lake is covered with water hyacinths and rarely any birds can be seen here.</p>
           <h4>Pashan Lake is a man-made lake located in the Pashan suburb of Pune, India, approximately 10 kilometers from the city center. It was originally constructed by the British in the late 1860s by bunding the Ramnadi river to provide water to the Pashan village and surrounding areas. Today, it's a popular spot for birdwatching, nature walks, and photography, though its water quality has been affected by urbanization. </h4>
          <p>This 100-year-old lake was home to numerous birds in the ’70s and ’80s. Today the lake is covered with water hyacinths and rarely any birds can be seen here.</p>
           <img src="pashan.jpg" alt="pashanlake">
                <p>Pashan Lake was once a huge water resource with the presence of local and migratory birds. However, nowadays it is covered with water hyacinths with a lonely bird or two spotted around it. Initially, there was a moorland and thorny plants spread all over this place. Later on, a weir was built on the Ramnadi to provide a water resource for the governor's house (today’s Savitribai Phule Pune University) and it was called Pashan Lake. Around the ’70s and ’80s, numerous birds were seen at this full-fledged water resource. The records made by birdwatchers such as Prakash Gole, Vijay Paranjape, and Sanjiv Nalawade provide information about the flourishing bird diversity present in the past. Earlier, rare birds like the pattakadam, some species of ducks, water birds, and migratory birds were seen in the surroundings of Pashan Lake. Today this diversity has immensely decreased and, therefore, immediate conservation measures need to be taken to save Pashan Lake.</p>
                <p>After 2004, the Pune Municipal Corporation made a plan of renovating Pashan Lake, which started in 2007. The Rs 20-crore project proved to be a curse for the beauty of Pashan Lake. The depth of the lake was increased using unscientific methods. The extracted sediment carried infinite invertebrates, which were the primary food for birds. Two islands were made inside the lake using this extracted material. The other decision of building a rock pitching for stabilising the lake also resulted in limiting the movement of birds. Ironically, a few prestigious organisations helped in this. The wall was built on the site of an area that contained most of the invertebrates. Birds like the sandpiper, snipe, plover, wagtail, red-wattled lapwing, and cormorants used to live in these areas. This decision made a negative impact on the movement and food of the birds living here.</p>
                <p>The most important factor in the destruction of Pashan Lake is unlimited pollution. Polluted water coming from the surrounding factories, by washing clothes and vehicles in the lake water, and coming straight from the Ramnadi destroyed the quality of the natural lake water. It resulted in decreasing the dissolved oxygen level of water. In such a situation it is difficult for fish and other water species to survive in the lake. Organic pollution promoted the growth of water hyacinths. It should be cleaned to restore the prosperity of the lake. This would promote the movement of birds like the pheasant-tailed jacana and the growth of local plants and organisms. Water birds like the kamal, white-breasted waterhen, Eurasian coot, little grebe, pond heron, egret and kingfisher are already present here. Apart from this, birds like the white-spotted fantail, red-vented bulbul, sunbird, spotted owlet, ashy prinia, tailorbird, baya weaver, cinereous tit, and dove make their nests in the surrounding trees of the lake. Although these birds are seen in the vicinity today, their numbers have decreased. Many foreign birds, like the ruddy shelduck, northern pintail, northern shoveller, tern, common teal, Eurasian wigeon, and gadwall, used to visit Pashan Lake in the winter. Now, most of them have stopped coming and others have decreased in number. All five species of wagtail are observed here. Forest wagtails and citrine wagtails are rarely seen. The number of grey wagtails, yellow wagtails, and white wagtails has incredibly decreased.</p>
                <p>Although Pashan Lake is on the verge of destruction, the government is still supporting this project. Punekars should come together and build a movement to save Pashan Lake. Firstly, it will pressurise the government to audit the renovation project and secondly oblige them to consider public opinion in future projects. Also by establishing a vigilance committee for such lakes and mountains we can stop the repetition of mistakes in the future.</p>

         <img src="rajgad.jpg" alt="Rajgad">
         <h4>About Rajgad</h4>
         <p>Rajgad is a Hill region fort situated in the Pune district of Maharashtra, India. Formerly known as Murumbdev, the fort was the first capital of the Maratha Empire under the rule of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj for almost 26 years, after which the capital was moved to the Raigad Fort.</p>
              <h4>At a distance of 54 km from Pune, Rajgad is an ancient hill fort situated in the Pune district of Maharashtra. It is one of the top tourist places in Pune and also one of the popular places of trekking in Maharashtra.</h4>
              <p>Rajgad Fort is one of the grand forts of the Sahaydris and lies at an altitude of 1400 m (4, 600 feet). Formerly known as Murumdev, Rajgad Fort was the capital of the Maratha Empire during the rule of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj for 25 years, before moving the capital to Raigad Fort. The Rajgad Fort was built with the treasure found on the adjacent Torna Fort. This was one of the favourite forts of Shivaji Maharaj and he stayed the most in this fort. Many historical events took place in this fort, such as the birth of Shivaji's son, Rajaram Chhatrapati, his queen, Saibai's death and Afzal Khan's head is buried in the fort.
</p><br>
           <p>The fort is divided into four parts, Padmavati Machi, Suvela Machi, Sanjeevani Machi, and Balekilla (small fort). The fort is an example of splendid design and construction. The diameter of the fort at the base is 40 km making it difficult for anybody to lay siege to it.
Sanjeevani Machi: The three layer fortification of Sanjeevani Machi is simply a marvel and is located on the southwest end. This extends approximately for 2.5 km along with many cisterns. The lower layers of the fort were separated by fortified bastion along with gate in order to defend independently. There is also an underground escape route which leads directly to the outermost fortification.
</p>
<img src="rajgad1.webp" alt="Rajgad">
<h3>Suvela Machi:</h3>
           <p> Suvela Machi, located on the eastern part of Rajgad fort, is a narrow strip that leads to a fortified end. Before the fortifications, there is a Hanuman temple and towards the right of the hanuman temple is Nedh. Nedh is a giant hole on the rock face about 3 m in diameter carved by years of erosion.</p>
           <h3>Padmavati Machi:</h3>
           <p>This part of Rajgad Fort was a military base as well as a residential area. The Padmavati Machi has a Lake, Padmavati Temple, Pali Darwaja, Chor Dwaraja, Gunjawane Darwaja, Diwankhana, Daru Kothar, Rajwada, and Ghod Tale. Besides these there is also a Samadhi of Saibai, Shivaji's first wife.
</p>
           <h3>Balekilla:</h3>
           <p>This site is one of the highest parts in the Fort Rajgad that includes caves, water cisterns and palaces. The entrance door of the Balekilla is called as Maha Dwaraja. From here, one can easily view the whole fort.
Rajgad is amongst the most popular trekking destinations near Pune. There are several trekking routes to reach the Fort. Trek to Padmavati Machi via Chor Darwaja is the most popular route and the trek starts from Gunjawane village. From Gunjawane the 4.5 km trek is a little bit tough and it takes almost 3 1/2 hours to reach Padmavati Machi. One needs to navigate a steep rocky incline to reach Chor Darwaza.
</p>
             
<br>
              <p>The trek via Pali Darwaza is a simple climb and it starts from Pali village. The 3.5 km trek from Pali should take approximately 2 hours to reach the fort. There is another route called Bhor route which starts from Bhutonde. From Bhutonde village, a 3 -4 hours trek will take visitors to Alu Darwaja of Rajgad. This route is not popular as other two routes. It is always recommended that visitors should carry their own drinking water and food.</p>

          <p>Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park, also known as Katraj Snake Park, is among the popular zoos in India. It is in Katraj, only a few kilometres away from Pune. So, it is a favourite among the local people and others who come to explore Pune.</p>
           <p>Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park is divided into three sections: the zoo, a lake, and a snake park. It also has a wildlife research centre, which serves as an animal orphanage, rescue centre and care centre.</p>
             <p>You can visit all these parts and watch the animals being cared for in a protective environment. Among the various animals in Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park & Wildlife Research Centre are leopards, black bucks and elephants. Then, you will find different species of snakes and other reptiles in the snake park.</p>

              <p>The zoo organizes various animal welfare activities, environmental awareness events and guided tours too. And it is a must-visit place for nature lovers, experience seekers, and wildlife enthusiasts.</p>
             <h4>History of Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park</h4>
             <p>The Rajiv Gandhi Zoo Park Katraj, you see today, began as the small Peshwe Park in 1953. It was created by Pune Municipal Corporation. Later, in 1987, it helped in setting up Katraj Snake Park.</p>
             <p>In 1997, a new zoo was planned, encompassing the Snake Park. And in 1999, Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park and Wildlife Research Centre Katraj opened. It was only a snake park, until 2005, with some deers and monkeys. Then, all the animals from Peshwe Park were brought to Pune Rajiv Gandhi Zoo. And Peshwe Park was closed.</p>
             <p>Sometime around 2007-08, the adjacent Animal Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre also became a part of Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park. The service was set up in 1992 to capture and rehabilitate snakes. But it grew to be a rescue centre for all injured and orphaned animals and birds. The zoo has also an animal adoption scheme since 2010.</p>
